**Human Action Recognition Web App**

This repository contains a comprehensive human action recognition web application built using Streamlit and Django. The application leverages the power of deep learning to accurately detect and classify human actions in images and videos. It provides an intuitive user interface for uploading media, visualizing predictions, and interacting with the model.

**Key Features:**

- **Streamlit Dashboard:** A user-friendly front-end powered by Streamlit, enabling users to easily upload images and videos for action recognition and visualize the model's predictions.

- **Django API Backend:** A robust Django backend serving as an API for the action recognition model. It handles image and video processing, inference, and responds with predictions.

- **Deep Learning Model:** Integration of a state-of-the-art deep learning model pre-trained for human action recognition. The model is fine-tuned and optimized for accuracy and efficiency.

- **Real-time Inference:** Efficient processing of uploaded media, allowing users to receive real-time predictions for human actions.

- **Scalable Deployment:** Dockerized deployment setup for easy scaling and management. Deploy the web app and API using cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, or deploy it locally.

**Usage:**

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Set up the virtual environment and install the required dependencies.
3. Train and fine-tune the action recognition model on your dataset or integrate a pre-trained model.
4. Configure the Django API backend and Streamlit front-end for seamless communication.
5. Run the Streamlit and Django servers and access the web app through your browser.
6. Upload images or videos, and experience real-time human action recognition.

**Contributions:**

Contributions to this project are welcome! Whether you want to enhance the model, improve the user interface, or optimize the deployment process, your ideas and pull requests are valuable contributions to the community.
